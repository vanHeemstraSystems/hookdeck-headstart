# 100 - Introduction

Hookdeck works by routing webhooks receive for a given source (ie: Shopify, Github, etc.) to its defined destination by connecting them with a connection to a destination. The CLI allows you to receive webhooks for any given connection and forward them to your localhost at the specified port or any valid URL.
